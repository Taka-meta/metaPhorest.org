# Shinya Sugiura

Born in 1999. Master's degree in Media Design. Graduated from the Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University.
While studying at the Kitasato University School of Science, he joined metaPhorest as an external research student in 2021. He conducted a cultural history survey and functional tests on the scent of osmanthus in a school-like setting, and discovered new sensory value for the scent. As an extension of this, he is attempting to separate and reconstruct the memories of time and space evoked by the scent into multiple language systems, and is exploring applications as basic design.Currently, in order to develop new sensory value in the design field, he is involved in a wide range of activities through the material development project "Cement Project" and the production technology development project "Vleur" to produce new materials.
