# Aki Inomata

Born in Tokyo, Japan in 1983, lives and works in Tokyo.
M.F.A., Tokyo University of the Arts, Department of Inter-Media Art, 2008.

Focusing on the act of "making" is not exclusive to human beings, Inomata creates art works with various species “collaboratively.” She investigates relationships between animals and human beings and the creation emerging from them.
Her major works include Why Not Hand Over a "Shelter” to Hermit Crabs?, an attempt she created 3d printed shells for hermit crabs and handed it over to them, and I Wear the Dog’s Hair, and the Dog Wears My Hair, in which the artist and her dog wear capes made from each other’s respective hair.
Her recent exhibitions include Broken Nature, MoMA (2021; New York, USA), AKI INOMATA: Significant Otherness, Towada Art Center (2019; Aomori, Japan), The XXII Triennale di Milano, La Triennale di Milano (2019; Italy), Thailand Biennale 2018 (Krabi), and Aki Inomata, Why Not Hand Over a “Shelter” to Hermit Crabs?, Musée d’arts de Nantes (2018; France).
