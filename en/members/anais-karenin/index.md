# Anais-karenin

Born in Brazil and based in Japan. Anais-karenin situates her practice in the intimate engagement with plants, researching pre-colonial knowledge systems on medicinal herbs, and reexamining the relationship between the scientific categories of plants and humans. She conducts research and fieldwork across various fields, reflecting on colonialism, language, territory, and science. Her artworks capture plants-stones-things in a new way through comprehensive expressive methods that deal with the cultivation of plant systems, installation, sound, scent, and image, appealing to a sensory and critical approach.  Major solo exhibitions include "Things named [things]" (The 5th Floor, Tokyo, 2023), "Mediate Plants" (Yebizo Meets Yebisu International Festival of Arts and Alternative Visions, Kobo Chika, Tokyo, 2023), and major group exhibitions include "Becoming Wild" (Towada Art Center, 2024), "The Senses of Plants" (Villa Merkel, Germany, 2024), "Gunma AIR" (The Museum of Modern Art, Gunma, 2024). She concluded her PhD at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and was a Visiting Research Fellow and Teaching Assistant at Waseda University.
