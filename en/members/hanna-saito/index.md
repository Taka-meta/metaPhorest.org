# Hanna Saito

Contemporary artist, born in 1988. After graduating from Tama Art University, Department of Crafts, Glass Course, he joined metaPhorest (biological/biomedia art platform) and started working in the bioart field. He is currently enrolled in the doctoral program of the Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies at the University of Tokyo (Yasuaki Kakehi Laboratory). He is also engaged in research while creating works using glass modeling based on physical and chemical glass production techniques, living organisms, organic matter, and image analysis. In recent years, he has been collecting and cultivating several species of wild slime molds for research and production. His main themes are reconsidering the division between nature/society and human/non-human, and the inseparability of the artist and the object of expression.
