# Henry Tan

Henry, member of FREAK Lab Thailand, metaPhorest Japan, and research fellow at CGSB, NYUAD, Henry explores the boundaries between life and simulation. He investigates how emerging technologies like synthetic biology, mixed reality, brain stimulation, and artificial intelligence blur the lines between the real and the simulated. His work delves into how life adapts and negotiates with a constantly changing environment, shaped by factors like climate change, geopolitics, and geoeconomics.
His upcoming projects 2024 include: 

1. Pillars of Creation
2. Sleep Is A Little Rest, Death Is A Little Growth
3. How to Explain Sleep to a Robot Cock?
