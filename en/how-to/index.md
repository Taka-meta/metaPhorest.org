## About

### GitHub, GitHub Pages and VitePress 

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a Version Control System, it stores and tracks changes of any text.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) are a simple way of hosting a static website. Static means, there is no database or scripts that have to run on the server. That makes it fast & secure.

This website uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) to generate the static website - it's also called a SSG (Static Site Generator)

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is a simple way to format text.

```markdown
This is _italic_.
This is **bold**.
This is ***bolditalic***.

## FAQ

#### I don't know how to use GitHub and Markdown, can you update the website for me?
Yes, we can. Please share a link to you content in the chat. Please prepare any images by scaling them down to 1000px max. [Goolge Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12014036?hl=en) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so) can export content in Markdown.

#### Why do I have to _commit_ content to GitHub?
`commit` means _saving_, but instead of overwritting any content, a history of changes is being kept. This also serves as a backup.

#### Can I add custom HTML to my page?
Yes.

#### Can I embed YouTube or Vimeo in my page?
Yes. Just copy the embed codes from YouTube and Vimeo.

#### Can I help with developing the site?
YES! Please look at the README.md file in the repo for more details.

#### Can you change the content for me all the time?
No. We can help you to get started, but after some time you should be able to do it yourself. It's really not complicated.
