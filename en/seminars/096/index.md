## ① Hiroki Matsumura, ‘A new relationship between humans and Daphnia magna built through Daphnia swimming’.
The project ‘Imitating Daphnia by swimming’, which attempted to imitate Daphnia magna swimming with high-viscosity lotion, will be introduced. The new project ‘All-Japan Daphnia Swimming Championships’ will also be explained.

### [Tomoki Matsumura](/en/members/tomoki-matsumura/)
Born in 1997. He has been swimming since childhood and won the Japanese Championships and competed in the World Championships in fin swimming in 2018. Due to her interest in life and art, she joined metaPhorest in 2020. Based on his swimming experience, he aims to develop and research Daphnia swimming and to examine the world of living organisms (Daphnia) through performance.

### ② Kentaro Aki: ‘Research on the production of bio-art that reconsiders the relationship with moss plants from the perspective of “moss clothing”’.
A year after joining metaPhorest, newcomer Kentaro Aki became interested in moss in Japanese culture, focusing in particular on the ‘moss robe’ in waka poems from the Kamakura period (1185-1333). He is exploring a new sense of distance between moss and people by making a monk's robe using only moss and actually wearing it.
